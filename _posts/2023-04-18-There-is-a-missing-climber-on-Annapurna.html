    Last year, a Pakistani climber achieved the remarkable feat of being the first from his country to reach the actual peak of Manaslu. This achievement was made all the more impressive by the fact that most expeditions had been abandoned due to multiple avalanches. The climber, Sadpara, has set his sights on climbing all 14 peaks over 8,000 meters using the alpine style.
</p>

<p>
    As of now, there is no information available regarding the cause of Maloo's accident. According to the latest update, <a href="https://share.garmin.com/broadboy"><span class="bold">Shehroze Kashif's </span></a>t
    racker shows his location at 6,788m, which is typically the height of Camp 3. However, this year, the Sherpas have established a Camp 4 at that altitude, which is lower than usual, and will be staying there for the night.
</p>

<br />

<p>
    Anurag Maloo, a 34-year-old man from Kishangargh, Rajasthan, India, reportedly went missing after falling from approximately 6,000m while descending from Camp III, 
    as stated by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/8000x14_mingma_sherpa/"> <span class="bold">Mingma Sherpa</span></a>, the Chairman of Seven Summit Treks.
</p>

<br />

<p>
    Anurag has set a goal to climb all 14 peaks that are higher than 8000 meters and the 7 Summits with the purpose of raising awareness and promoting action towards
    accomplishing the United Nations Global Goals (#ClimbingForSDGs). He has received recognition for his efforts, including the REX KaramVeer Chakra award and being 
    selected as the 2041 Antarctic Youth Ambassador from India.

<p>
    Yesterday, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063558587746"> <span class="bold">Jonathan Lamy </span></a>from France successfully reached the summit and spent the night at Camp 4, which is located at an altitude of 6,700 meters.
    However, as of today, he has not yet descended from Camp 4. Lamy shared a message in French stating that the freezing temperatures have made it difficult for him to 
    stay at Camp 4 any longer and he needs to descend. He also mentioned feeling mentally exhausted but physically fine. Additionally, Lamy expressed gratitude towards his 
    Sherpa, ChongBi, for his heroism.

<p>
    Today, <span class="bold">Bartek Ziemski</span> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oswaldrp/?hl=en"><span class="bold">Oswald Rodrigo Pereira</span> </a> successfully reached the summit of Annapurna without using supplementary oxygen or personal porters. The Polish 
    Mountaineering Association reported that they were resting at Camp 4. Although Ziemski had plans to ski down from the summit, it's unclear if he followed through with this. 
    Two days ago, Pereira mentioned that they faced some unforeseen difficulties. However, today, the team announced that they managed to summit the mountain despite having 
    limited time for acclimatization.
