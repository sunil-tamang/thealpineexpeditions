<p>
    According to expedition organizers, at least 54 climbers successfully reached the summit of Annapurna (8,091m), making it the first ascent of the season. <span class="bold">Sajid Ali Sadpara</span>,
    who is the son of the renowned Pakistani mountaineer <span class="bold">Mohammad Ali Sadpara</span>, also achieved a successful summit of the peak without using supplemental oxygen, as reported by his
    expedition organizer, <a href="https://www.sevensummittreks.com/"><span class="bold">Seven Summit Treks</span></a>.
</p>

<br />

<p>
    Sadpara has achieved successful summits of K2 (8,611m), Gasherbrum-I (8,080m), Gasherbrum-II (8,035m), and Manaslu without the aid of supplemental oxygen. His upcoming goal is to conquer three more
    peaks, namely Kangchenjunga (8,586 m), Dhaulagiri (8,167 m), and Makalu (8,481m), also without the use of oxygen, during the spring season.

<!-- <p>
    Last year, a Pakistani climber achieved the remarkable feat of being the first from his country to reach the actual peak of Manaslu. This achievement was made all the more impressive by the fact that most expeditions had been abandoned due to multiple avalanches. The climber, Sadpara, has set his sights on climbing all 14 peaks over 8,000 meters using the alpine style.
</p> 

<br /> -->

<p>
    From mid-March, climbers flocked to Annapurna base camp with the goal of summiting the peak by early April. Unfortunately, continuous snowfall disrupted their expedition, causing some teams to abandon 
    their efforts and return to Kathmandu. Other teams decided to take a break from the mountain for a few days.
</p>

<br />

<p>
    However, a team of Sherpas led by Pasang Nurbu Sherpa from Seven Summit Treks successfully secured the climbing rope to the summit on Friday morning. The teams from Imagine Nepal Treks and Elite Expeditions 
    were also able to reach the summit.
</p>

<br />

<p>
    The summit was reached by a team of six foreign climbers and eight Sherpas from Imagine Nepal. The climbers included 
    <span class="bold">Wang Zhong from China</span>,
    <span class="bold">Naoki Ishikawa from Japan</span>, 
    <span class="bold">Sashko Kedev from Macedonia</span>, 
    <span class="bold">Maria Alexandra Danila from Romania</span>, 
    <span class="bold">Nadia Lisa Khoso from the UK</span>, and 
    <span class="bold">Jill Wheatley from Canada</span>. They were supported by 
    <span class="bold">Kili Pemba Sherpa</span>, 
    <span class="bold">Tamting Sherpa</span>, 
    <span class="bold">Phur Galjen Sherpa</span>, 
    <span class="bold">Dawa Sherpa</span>,
    <span class="bold">Tshering Samduk Sherpa</span>, 
    <span class="bold">Suman Gurung</span>, 
    <span class="bold">Ngima Nuru Sherpa</span>, and 
    <span class="bold">Pemba Chhiri Sherpa</span>.
    
</p>


<br />

<p>
    Mingma Gyalje Sherpa, also known as Mingma G, led his team back from Camp II on Annapurna to participate in the search and rescue operation for his three missing guides involved in the Khumbu accident on 
    April 12th. The avalanche was caused by a massive collapse of a serac in the Khumbu Icefall, which swept three of his climbers into crevasse
</p>

<br />

<p>
    The rescue team has located a possible area where the three individuals may have been buried under an ice mass. In a Facebook post, it was mentioned that digging them out would require risking more lives, 
    so they had to be left under the ice. Mingma G, the owner of Imagine Nepal expedition company, has also pledged to provide assistance to the families of the deceased on his birthday, as stated in his post on 
    Friday.
</p>

<br />

<p>
    The Expedition Operator's Association Nepal has assigned <a href="https://imagine-nepal.com/"><span class="bold">IMAGINE NEPAL</span></a>  to take charge of fixing the line above Camp II this season, a 
    responsibility previously carried out by Seven Summit Treks. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mingma.g/?hl=en"><span class="bold">Mingma G</span></a> , a renowned mountaineer and IFMGA Guide, along with
    his team of experienced Sherpa guides who are experts in fixing ropes in several 8,000-meter peaks, has started the rope fixing task. Unfortunately, an incident occurred during the early stages of the operation.
    Nonetheless, Mingma G's team persevered and continued with their mission. Notably, the three missing guides were not part of the rope fixing team.
