			Being born in the lap of Himalayas, in the Manali Valley, we've seen it - the mountains top, the Beas River gushing through the narrow mountains, the wild &amp; dense forests and so much more. We've climbed almost all the mountain range and trekked the mountain passes such as Rohtang Pass

	Kufri Trek yup there is another kufri in Kullu Manali is the best camping spot in kullu Valley yet Virgin .
	Besides all the popular trek's of Kullu-Manali the Kufri trek is unique in its own way the trek begins from Raison just 14 km from kullu Town
    we take a cab or we can wallk to jalora village from where trek officially begins we follow the path of local route making our way crossing the
	green forest of pine cone trees to the empty Grass Meadows at kufri there is a small House owned by my Negi's of Raison as you can see in above image.

	Just one hour hike from kufri there is place called Tin Tin Pathar where big rocks lying in meadows
	that resonate like a bell when struck with each other . Local's named this place as Tin Tin Pathar beacause if you struck these rocks with each other it
	makes the metal sound like tin tin .

	Kufri trek is shortest trek in kullu manali valley of Himachal Pradesh remains opened for all year from Jan to Dec .In winter season from Oct to Feb
	the trails is packed with snow upto 5Ft and makes the trail harder to hike but the view in winter is amazing as you would not want to leave this place .
	No city polution no traffic this place is the perfect getaway location for camping and weekend trips .During summer season from April to Aug trail is easy to hike
	with greenary all over the place lush green meadows that you would miss in winter season so both season offers different view and experience of kufri .
	although if you are a camping lover wanna spend night in jungle with Bonfire summer time from april to Aug might be best time for you to visit this Unexplored trek of kullu manali .
