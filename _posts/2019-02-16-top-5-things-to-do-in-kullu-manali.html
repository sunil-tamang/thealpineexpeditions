	Being born in the lap of Himalayas, in the Manali Valley, we've seen it - the mountains top, the Beas River gushing through the narrow mountains,
	the wild &amp; dense forests and so much more. We've climbed almost all the mountain range and trekked the mountain passes such as Hampta Pass,
	sarkundi pass, sar pass, pin parvati pass and many more treks in the valley.
