    Last year, a Pakistani climber achieved the remarkable feat of being the first from his country to reach the actual peak of Manaslu. This achievement was made all the more impressive by the fact that most expeditions had been abandoned due to multiple avalanches. The climber, Sadpara, has set his sights on climbing all 14 peaks over 8,000 meters using the alpine style.
