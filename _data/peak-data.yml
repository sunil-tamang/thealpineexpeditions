  description: "Lobuche East Peak (6,119m) is a bit more challenging than other trekking peaks, located in the Khumbu region of Nepal. This peak requires professional mountaineering skills. Climbers will navigate steep rocky terraces and snow slopes just below the main glaciers on the southwest face of Lobuche East. The route follows a sharp snow ridge to the summit ridge, then continues northwest towards the main summit, passing several small snow bumps and reaching a notch. The final ascent involves climbing steep and quite difficult snow slopes to the summit. The view from the summit is superb, with many mountains of the Rongbuk side of Tibet visible as well."
